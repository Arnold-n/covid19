Here are a few bits of Python code for epidemiological simulations
and analysis of NL statistics.

I develop using Anaconda Python (version 2020.02) in Linux. The code
should generally run in Windows and other Python distributions, but is
not tested. (I use Python 3.7, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy.)
